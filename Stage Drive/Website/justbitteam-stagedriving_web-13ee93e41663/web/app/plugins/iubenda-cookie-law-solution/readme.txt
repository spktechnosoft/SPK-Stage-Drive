iubenda Cookie Solution allows you to make your website GDPR compliant and manage all aspects of cookie law on WP, particularly fit for Italy.

== Description ==

This plugin is an All-in-One approach developed by iubenda that helps to make your website GDPR compliant by generating the privacy policy text, the cookie banner and the blocking management of cookies.

This plugin works with the iubenda Cookie Law Solution and allows to block the most common widgets and third party cookies to comply with Cookie Laws, particularly with the Italian cookie law implementation in mind.

* The plugin automatically inserts the iubenda code in the head of every page of the site
* It allows to manually block all the remaining resources, without the need of direct intervention on the code
* It handles the display of cookie banners and cookie policy, saving user preferences about the use of cookies
* It displays a clean page (without banner) to users who have already provided their consent
* It detects bots/spiders and serves them a clean page

**The plugin is currently capable of automatically detecting and blocking the following scripts:**

* Google Analytics
* Google Maps
* Google AdSense
* Google ReCaptcha
* Google Site Search
* Google Tag Manager
* Google oAuth
* Google+ widgets
* Twitter widgets
* Facebook widgets
* Facebook Comments
* YouTube
* Vimeo
* Linkedin widgets
* ShareThis widgets
* Instagram widgets
* AddThis widgets
* Pinterest widgets
* PayPal widgets
* Disqus
* Optimizely
* Neodata
* Criteo
* Outbrain
* Headway
* Codepen
* Freshchat
* Uservoice
* AdRoll
* Olark
* Segment
* Kissmetrics
* Mixpanel
* Pingdom
* Bing
* Elevio

**Some background information**

If you have European users you will know the problem: you need to obtain consent for the usage of many types of cookies and you need to manage that consent somehow. Now even Google forces cookie consent onto users of Google AdSense, DoubleClick for Publishers, and DoubleClick Ad Exchange (and even Google Analytics in some cases). Time to get started with a cookie banner.

iubenda and the Cookie Law Solution extension for WordPress help remove these complex tasks with a couple of clicks. This extension works with the iubenda Cookie Law Solution, displays a cookie banner in 8 languages and saves consent for returning users.

**Which languages does iubenda work in currently?**

* English
* Italian
* French
* Spanish
* Portuguese (Brazilian)
* German
* Dutch
* Russian

**Manual Usage**

How to make the plugin manually work for a Facebook button?

    <!--IUB-COOKIE-BLOCK-START-->
    <script>
    (function(d, s, id) {
     var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
     if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
     js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
     js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3&appId=808061959224601";
     fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
    }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));
    </script>
    <!--IUB-COOKIE-BLOCK-END-->

If there are HTML / IMG / IFRAME elements, you need to proceed in this way:

    <!--IUB-COOKIE-BLOCK-START-->
          <iframe src="...
          <img src="...
    <!--IUB-COOKIE-BLOCK-END-->

Inside a post/page content there's a shortcode available:

    [iub-cookie-policy]
    [/iub-cookie-policy]

In case of continued browsing, the preferences of your users for the use of cookies will be set on "OK" to clear the banner and unlock the cookies. Moreover, banners and the blocking codes will not be delivered to subsequent visits by users who have already given their consent (and such preference will be updated at each subsequent visit for the future).

== Installation ==

- Search in your WordPress plugins admin panel for "iubenda Cookie Solution", install it;
- Once the plugin is installed and activated, go to the Admin Panel -> iubenda menu where you will be asked to paste the code into tht field that gets generated from your Iubenda account dashboard when you activate the cookie law kit for your privacy policy. For more information on how to activate the cookie law kit, see this article: https://www.iubenda.com/it/help/posts/680;
- At this point the plugin will begin to show the banner on which displays your cookie policy (link) to users who visit the site for the first time. No need for other configurations;
- Furthermore, the plugin automatically recognizes and blocks cookies that get installed via the YouTube video player and social widgets - such as the Facebook Like Box - on your site. **Important note** the scripts for Facebook, Twitter, G+, and YouTube iframe only get blocked automatically when generated from the server side (therefore processed by PHP via WordPress). Scripts that are added to the page via Javascript after page load cannot be blocked automatically;
- If you'd like to manually block a specific script "wrap" it eith the following HTML comments:

      `<!--IUB-COOKIE-BLOCK-START-->
      <!--IUB-COOKIE-BLOCK-END-->`
- In case you're querying WordPress via API, you can disable our plugin by using the iub_no_parse=true URL parameter, like this: www.example.com/api/get_recent_posts?iub_no_parse=true.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot shows the default banner on top of our test site testkada4.altervista.org/cookie-test/example2.html
2. When clicking on the cookie policy link, the user gets a view of the entire cookie policy, where they ultimately can give their consent
3. It's as simple as copy-pasting the code from iubenda into the plugin form.
